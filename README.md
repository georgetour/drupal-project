# Composer template for Drupal projects
It will have most common modules used in many projects like google_analytics, paragraphs etc.

## Usage

First you need to [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the [global composer installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).
You might need to replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` (or similar) 
for your setup.

After that you can create the project:

```
composer create-project georgetour/drupal-project:8.x-dev some-dir --stability dev --no-interaction
```

With `composer require ...` you can download new dependencies to your 
installation.

```
cd some-dir
composer require drupal/devel:~1.0
```

The `composer create-project` command passes ownership of all files to the 
project that is created. You should create a new git repository, and commit 
all files not excluded by the .gitignore file.
